### Cursor Availability

Before launching Cursor workers, verify \`cursor-agent\` is installed and authenticated. If it is unavailable, stop and report: install/authenticate \`cursor-agent\` for Cursor worker support. Do not silently fall back to Claude-only execution in a way that hides the missing Cursor dependency.`

Configured autopilot team worker types include CLI-backed workers: ${requested}. For executor-style implementation work, use the tmux CLI team runtime instead of in-process Claude-only Task subagents.

Use one of these equivalent surfaces from the lead session:

\`\`\`sh
omc team ${agentSpec} "<implementation task from ${planPath}>"
\`\`\`

Or from Claude Code slash commands:

\`\`\`text
/omc-teams ${agentSpec} "<implementation task from ${planPath}>"
\`\`\`

Requested worker types: ${requested}. Keep these CLI workers executor-style only: implementation, file edits, build/test fixes, and other plan execution tasks. Keep reviewer, critic, security-review, validation verdict, and final approval roles on the native Claude/OMC reviewer agents unless this repository explicitly adds safe role support for that CLI worker type.${cursorGuidance}`;

Execute the implementation plan using multi-worker team execution.

### Setup

Read the implementation plan at: \`${planPath}\`

### Team Execution

${teamRuntimeGuidance}

${useCliTeamRuntime ? `1. **Launch CLI executor workers** with \`omc team\` or \`/omc-teams\` using the requested agent types.
2. **Decompose executor-style implementation tasks** from the implementation plan and pass them to CLI workers.
3. **Monitor tmux/team output** and integrate completed implementation changes.
4. **Keep review/critic/security/verdict work native**; do not assign those roles to Cursor/CLI workers.
5. **Coordinate** dependencies between tasks.` : `1. **Create team** with TeamCreate
2. **Create tasks** from the implementation plan using TaskCreate
3. **Spawn executor teammates** using Task with \`team_name\` parameter
4. **Monitor progress** as teammates complete tasks
5. **Coordinate** dependencies between tasks.`}

### Output Contract

Every teammate response must stay concise: return ONLY a short execution summary under 100 words covering what changed, files touched, verification status, and blockers. Store bulky logs/details in files or artifacts and reference them briefly.

### Agent Selection

${useCliTeamRuntime ? `Use the requested CLI worker spec for executor-style implementation tasks only. Keep task prompts framed as implementation/build/test-fix work; do not ask Cursor/CLI workers to act as reviewers, critics, security reviewers, or final verdict agents.` : `Match agent types to task complexity:
- Simple tasks (single file, config): \`executor\` with \`model="haiku"\`
- Standard implementation: \`executor\` with \`model="sonnet"\`
- Complex work (architecture, refactoring): \`executor\` with \`model="opus"\`
- Build issues: \`debugger\` with \`model="sonnet"\`
- Test creation: \`test-engineer\` with \`model="sonnet"\`
- UI work: \`designer\` with \`model="sonnet"\``}

### Progress Tracking

Track progress through the task list:
- Mark tasks \`in_progress\` when starting
- Mark tasks \`completed\` when verified
- Add discovered tasks as they emerge

### Completion

When ALL tasks from the plan are implemented:

Signal: ${EXECUTION_COMPLETION_SIGNAL}
`;
    }

    // Solo execution mode
    return `## PIPELINE STAGE: EXECUTION (Solo Mode)

Execute the implementation plan using single-session execution.

### Setup

Read the implementation plan at: \`${planPath}\`

### Solo Execution

Execute tasks sequentially (or with limited parallelism via background agents):

1. Read and understand each task from the plan
2. Execute tasks in dependency order
3. Use executor agents for independent tasks that can run in parallel
4. Track progress in the TODO list

### Output Contract

Every spawned executor response must return ONLY a short execution summary under 100 words covering what changed, files touched, verification status, and blockers. Store bulky logs/details in files or artifacts and reference them briefly.

### Agent Spawning

\`\`\`
// For simple tasks (single file, straightforward logic)
Task(subagent_type="oh-my-claudecode:executor", model="haiku", prompt="...")

// For standard implementation (feature, multiple methods)
Task(subagent_type="oh-my-claudecode:executor", model="sonnet", prompt="...")

// For complex work (architecture, debugging, refactoring)
Task(subagent_type="oh-my-claudecode:executor", model="opus", prompt="...")
\`\`\`

### Progress Tracking

Update TODO list as tasks complete:
- Mark task \`in_progress\` when starting
- Mark task \`completed\` when done
- Add new tasks if discovered during implementation

### Completion

When ALL tasks from the plan are implemented:

Signal: ${EXECUTION_COMPLETION_SIGNAL}
`;
